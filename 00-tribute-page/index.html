            <h3>April 26, 121</h3>
            <p>
              Marcus Aurelius was born on 26 April 121 into a wealthy, prominent family in Rome, Italy. He was extremely
              bright as a young boy and was a dedicated student, tutored by many private educators.

            <h3>140</h3>
            <p>
              In 140 CE, Aurelius became emissary, or leader of the senate—a post he would hold twice in his life. As
              the
              years passed, he was given more political errands and official powers and thus, he slowly progressed into
              a
              sturdy source of backing and guidance for Antoninus, his father.

              He married Faustina the Younger, a relative, in 145. The couple had 14 children together in their marriage
              of three decades. Two of them went on to become famous; Lucilla and Commodus.

            <p>
              During this time, he also continued to study philosophy and harbored an interest in law. After his father
              passed away in 161 CE, he rose to power and was officially known as &#39;Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
              Augustus&#39;.

              Following the sudden death of his brother, Verus (possibly due to an illness), in 169 CE, Aurelius
              continued the battle with his troops, fighting the Germans back from the border.

              In 175 CE, his position as the emperor was challenged by none other than Avidius Cassius, his general.
              While Aurelius was away combating the Germans, rumors were rife that that he had become seriously ill.
              Seizing the opportunity, Cassius claimed the title of emperor for himself.

              In 177 CE, Aurelius made his son, Commodus, his co-ruler. They fought the German tribes and also tussled
              with the northern enemies of the empire, while trying to extend the empire&#39;s geographical borders.

              He passed away in Vindobona (Vienna) on 17 March 180 and his ashes were taken back to Rome. His son,
              Commodus, succeeded his father as the emperor. In 410, his battles against the Germans were memorialized
              by
              a pillar and a shrine in Rome.

        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
          Marcus Annius Verus was born in a prominent and established family but nobody at the time would have predicted
          that he would one day be Emperor of the Empire. There is little that is known of his childhood but he was a
          serious young man who also enjoyed wrestling, boxing and hunting. Around his teenage years, the reigning
          emperor
          at the time, Hadrian was nearing death and was childless. He had to pick a successor and after his first
          choice,
          Lucius Ceionius, died unexpectedly, he chose Antoninus. He was a senator who was also childless and he would
          have to adopt Marcus, as per Hadrian&#39;s condition, as well as Ceionius&#39;s son, Lucius Verus. This is how
          Marcus&#39;s
          name changed to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once Hadrian died, it was clear that Marcus was next in line for the most important position in the empire.
          His
          education would become of serious concern and he would have the privilege of studying under Herodes Atticus, a
          rhetorician from Athens (Marcus would later write his Meditations in Greek) as well as Marcus Cornelius
          Fronto,
          his instructor in Latin whose letters of correspondence with Marcus survive to this day. Marcus would also
          serve
          as a consul twice thus receiving a valuable and practical education.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 161, as Antoninus died and ended one of the longest reigns, Marcus became the Emperor of the Roman Empire
          and
          ruled for nearly two decades until his death in 180. He also co-ruled in the beginning with Lucius Verus, his
          adopted brother until Lucius&#39; death eight years later. His reign wasn&#39;t easy: wars with the Parthian
          Empire, the
          barbarian tribes menacing the Empire on the northern border, the rise of Christianity as well as the plague
          that
          left numerous dead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marcus&#39;s death came in 180 in his military headquarters in modern day Vienna. The historian Cassius Dio
          describes Marcus&#39;s attitude towards his son, Commodus who he made co-emperor few years earlier and was now
          to
          succeed him: “[Marcus] was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout
          practically
          his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and
          extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him
          from
          being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was
          vastly
          disappointed in him.”
